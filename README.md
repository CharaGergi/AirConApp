**ANDROID APPLICATION - REMOTE CONTROL FOR AIR CONDITIONERS**

The application focuses on visually-impaired people, that's why it has functionalities like voice commands, but
the goal is to be an easy-to-use app for all regardless age or familiarity with technology.

The assignment was done for the course of Human-Computer Interaction. 
Done alongside [@DioTsolakou](https://github.com/DioTsolakou) and [@Vasiliki Vasilopoulou](https://github.com/vasilopoulou).
